# Bat-Hacks
Welcome to Bat-Hacks. This is a personal project of mine. I'm practicing my python skills while chasing my passion for hacking. Bat-Hacks is my all in one hacking program. I plan on updating it's functionability as I learn more skills and advance my programming knowledge.

What is currently on Bat-Hacks:
1. base64 encryption and decryption
2. working on bat-ography: my own cryptography key specific to Bat-Hacks. It's hardcoded rn because it's easy to decrypt, but that will most likley change in near future.
3. ACK scanning
4. Packet Sniffing
5. Ping of Death (Educational use only)
6. nothing else, but I do plan on adding more

What is needed to run Bat-Hacks: 
1. You will need to download Python (Youtube it if you don't know how to download it. Also don't be lame learn to code don't just be a script kiddie)
2. You will need the scapy library. Scapy documentation: https://scapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html
   Everything you need to know about Scapy is there.

Want to help? Add a comment on what I should add or something idk, I want feedback on this project!

So yeah, the code probably looks botched but I'm trying my best to make it look tidy. I also have no professional programming background so I am doing the best I can. 
Enjoy, or don't idc lol >.<
