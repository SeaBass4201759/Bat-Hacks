# Bat-Hacks
Welcome to Bat-Hacks. This is a personal project of mine. I'm practicing my python skills while chasing my passion for hacking. Bat-Hacks is my all in one hacking program. I plan on updating it's functionability as I learn more skills and advance my programming knowledge.

What is currently on Bat-Hacks:
1. base64 encryption and decryption
2. working on bat-ography: my own cryptography key specific to Bat-Hacks. It's hardcoded rn because it's easy to decrypt, but that will most likley change in near future.
3. ACK scanning
4. Packet Sniffing
5. nothing else, but I do plan on adding more

Want to help? Add a comment on what I should add or something idk, I want feedback on this project!

So yeah, the code probably looks botched but I'm trying my best to make it look tidy. I also have no professional programming background so I am doing the best I can. 
Enjoy, or don't idc lol >.<
